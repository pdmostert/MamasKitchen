# Clean up Task List

## Methodology
- Use a checklist to ensure all aspects of the code are reviewed.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle: Avoid over complicating the code.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle: Eliminate redundancy.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle: Avoid adding functionality until it is necessary.

## Code review
- Ensure consistent coding style and formatting.
- Check for any unused variables or imports.
- Clean up any commented-out code that is no longer needed.
- Verify that all functions and methods have appropriate docstrings or comments. Not excessive but enough to understand the purpose. If I look at this code in 6 months, will I understand what it does?
- Remove any redundant or duplicate code.
- Look for opportunities to simplify complex logic or improve readability.
- Look for opportunities to modularize code into smaller, reusable functions or classes.

## Styling
- Review CSS for consistency in naming conventions and organization.
- Ensure that styles are not duplicated and are applied efficiently.
- Remove any unused CSS rules.
- Ensure that the design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes including mobile devices.
- Check for accessibility compliance (e.g., color contrast, font sizes, keyboard navigation).
- I know the meal planner does not respond well to mobile. Fix that.

## Perspective
- Review the overall structure and organization of the codebase.
- Remember that I am new to JavaScript. Is the codebase structured in a way that is easy to understand and navigate for someone with my level of experience?

## Project Requirements
The technology stack is HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
It is OK to use a CSS responsive framework and CSS libraries for your web application project.
You may NOT use any JS framework or library.
Use at least two (2) external third-party API.
One of those third-party APIs cannot be OpenWeatherMap.
All exposed features are operational.
Be a combination of static and dynamically generated markup.
Incorporate CSS animation.
The code must be clean, well-commented, and organized. Show a good organization (ES Modules, classes, etc).
The code is error free (according to ESLint rules).
The application meets web frontend development standards using valid, contemporary HTML and CSS. There are no accessibility errors and the pages follow best practices and basic SEO recommendations.



## Skill Development Outcome
This outcome is demonstrated by your skill in the following learning objectives:

Objective	%	Description
JavaScript	25%	Robust programming logic is demonstrated.

For example, validating the screen data, looping through an array of JSON data to display to the screen, creating and using events, changing element styles with JS, changing element classes to use different CSS rules.
Third-party APIs	15%	APIs are used effectively, including APIs that provide rich JSON data.
JSON	15%	Demonstrate skill processing JSON data to dynamically update the website.
CSS	15%	Appropriate use of Transforms and Transitions. For example: Add round the edges to DIV, add shadows. enlarge an input field on focus and shrink it on blur, Add borders. CSS should subtly add style to a page.
Events	15%	Use events to enhance the user experience. For example, increase the size of the input field on focus or add a shadow. React to a button click. Initialized the page with data once the onload event triggers.
Local Storage	5%	Local storage is used effectively.
